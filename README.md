## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

This was the first attempt using flex and trying responsive design. while my solution adjusts for smaller screens I think having read more I should be designing Mobile First and then scaling up rather than Desktop First and scaling down.

### Continued development

I need to read further about flex vs grid and also responsive design.
